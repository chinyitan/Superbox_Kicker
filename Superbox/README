This is a brief description of the basic use of superbox

There are a few key subroutines
* super.cb  where one can choose the number of cells per box (N=2**m) and the maximum number of galaxies in the simulation (mg)

* pusher1.f In this file one can define the external force and potential (subroutine force) acting on the model N-body particles (here i include forced, which calculates the force+potential of a Miyamoto-Nagai disc, forceb, which calculates the force+potential of a Hernquist (1990, ApJ 356, 359) spherical bulge; and force_an, which calculates the force and potential of a spherical Navarro,Frenk and White (1997 ApJ 490, 493) dark matter halo. The parameters of the external potentials are determined in the subroutine param

The code reads models with extension .CONT, and upgrades this file after each time-step. This is a binary file with a definite structure. The first line contains 60 integers, and the second line 60 real*4. This is the description

The following lines should provide the position and velocity vector (6 real*4 numbers) of each N-body particle (of a single galaxy, i.e. ngalaxies=1) of a total of nb.

      open (2,file=name,access='direct',recl=24)

      do i=1,nb
         xx(i)=rad(1,i)*dr
         yy(i)=rad(2,i)*dr
         zz(i)=rad(3,i)*dr

         uu(i)=vel(1,i)*dv *sqrt(2.)
         vv(i)=vel(2,i)*dv *sqrt(2.)
         ww(i)=vel(3,i)*dv *sqrt(2.)

         write(2,rec=10+ngalaxies*10+i)
     &        xx(i),yy(i),zz(i),uu(i),vv(i),ww(i)   
      enddo
      close(2)

Note the sqrt(2) multiplying the velocities. This is due to the (unfortunate) choice of G=2 in superbox (originally this was chosen to speed up the calculations...now it is just annoying). Note also dr, and dv, which convert physical into N-body units. For galaxies the following units are useful

Munit=5.6e10 Msol
runit=3.5 kpc
vunit=262. km/s
tunit=0.013 Gyr

*wsdata.f Sanpshots are written by the sbroutine wsdata.f. Here I have chosen to write the position/velocty vectors, the kinetic plus potential energy in the satellite (de(1,i),de(2,i)) and host galaxy (de(3,i),de(4,i) frames. tm(i) is the time since the particle becomes unbound from the satellite, and the 6 following numbers is the position+velocity vector of the satellite.
